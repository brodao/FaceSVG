# SVG Face Export - compatible with Shaper Origin

This is a plugin to generate an SVG outline from selected faces.  The plugin adds a couple operations to the "context menu" (right click) when a face is selected or to select the current face. "Layout SVG profile" transform the face's inner and outer edges onto a newly created group.  "Write SVG profile" converts the edges that have been laid out into a SVG file.

**If you find this useful, _especially for the Shaper Origin_, send me, say, $18 via** [paypal.me/marvingreenberg/20](https://paypal.me/marvingreenberg/18).  (You know, one roll of shaper tape) If enough people are supporting this I'll make an effort to improve this actively.

See the YouTube video to see its operation.  My plan is to iterate through various improvements quickly.  My goal is to provide useful functionality for generating customized SVG output directly from Sketchup without requiring other software tools.  My near term goal is a slight improvment to allow changes, from within Sketchup, to layed-out edges to be reflected in the output SVG.  I also want to add support for Shaper Origin "pocket cuts".   I'm also very open to suggestions from the user community to improve or add features.

The output SVG file should be compatible for use with the Shaper Origin handheld CNC router and with other applications requiring SVG output.
